# ReflectOnMee
Anki Addon: Helps Alleviate RGS


# Config
Enable using deck menu options.


# About
This addon is used to prevent users from developing Reflex Grading Syndrome (RGS) in which a user will grade a card and proceed from card to card without reflecting much on the incorrect answer. RGS may or may not be caused by hindsight bias, but in all likely case, a user may simply not want to face the reality of being wrong. Overtime, this develops into a reflex of swiping away the wrong answer. With this addon enabled, once the user exceeds a certain time limit, the reviewer will enforece a set time before accepting a grade. Hopefully, during this short pause, they will use it to familiarize themselves with the material.
